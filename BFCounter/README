BFCounter is a memory efficient program for counting k-mers from sequencing files.

Installation
============
Just run make to compile.

% make

The default maximum k-mer size supported is 31 (8 bytes of memory per k-mer), to modify this either
replace MAX_KMER_SIZE in Makefile with an appropriate number or directly to make with

% make MAX_KMER_SIZE=64

In this case it the maximum k-mer size allowed is 63, and each k-mer will use 16 bytes of memory.

Running
=======
To run the program use

% ./BFCounter

To list available commands

% ./BFCounter count
% ./BFCounter dump

will provide more complete help.

Notes
=====

* BFCounter dump will print a text file with each k-mer and the number of occurrances of the k-mer.
  Only counts of 2 and greater will be printed, there is no limit on the number of occurrances it can handle.
  For each k-mer only the lexicographically smaller of the k-mer and the reverse complement of the k-mer, will be printed
  and the counts will be the sum of both values.

* BFCounter was developed on x86-64 GNU/Linux. Porting to other unix-like
  platforms should be easy, but we haven't done so yet.
