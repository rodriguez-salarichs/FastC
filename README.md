--------

FastC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on treated sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems. It is similar to FastQC allowing a comparative study between raw and processed data.

The main functions of FastC are

    1) Import of data from Fasta file
    2) Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
    3) Output PDF report
